4 - Suppose that you have **conventional Unix filesystem** with the following parameters:
16KB block size, 16-bit block address, 4 direct pointers per inode, 1 indirect pointer per inode.
- How large can a **single file** become using only the direct pointers?
- What is the largest **single file** that this filesystem could represent?
- What is the largest **disk** that this filesystem could fully use?
- How large would the free block bitmap be for the largest possible disk?

5 - Suppose that you have **conventional Unix filesystem** with the following parameters:
4KB block size, 32-bit block address, 7 direct pointers per inode, 1 indirect pointer per inode.
- How large can a **single file** become using only the direct pointers?
- What is the largest **single file** that this filesystem could represent?
- What is the largest **disk** that this filesystem could fully use?
- How large would the free block bitmap be for the largest possible disk?

Q1 - State precisely in one sentence the effect and return value of the `fork()` system call in Unix.

Q2 - State precisely in one sentence the effect and return value of the `execl()` system call in Unix.

<hr>

Now, the most common and expected way of using `fork` and `execl` is this:

```
pid = fork();
if(pid==0) {
    execl("program",...);
    _exit(1);
} else if(pid>0) {
    wait(&status);
}
```

Which results in a single child process running "program".
And, the parent process waits for the completion of the child.
This can be sketched as a process tree, like this:

But there are many other ways to put the pieces together,
some of them useful, and some of them just plain wrong.
as shown below.  Suppose that a program named "shell"
executes the following code snippets.  (You may assume
that `fork` and `execl` always succeed in these examples.)

Q3 - Sketch a diagram showing the outcome of this program:

```
fork();
execl("program",...);
```

Q4 - Sketch a diagram showing the outcome of this program:

```
execl("program",...);
fork();
```

Q5 - Sketch the outcome of this program:
```
fork();
fork();
execl("program",...");
```

Q6 - Sketch the outcome of this program:
```
for(i=0;i<8;i++) {
    pid = fork();
    if(pid==0) {
        execl("program",...):
    }
}
```

Q7 - Sketch the outcome of this program: (notice the `!=`)
```
for(i=0;i<8;i++) {
    pid = fork();
    if(pid!=0) {
        execl("program",...):
    }
}
```

Q8 - Sketch the outcome of this program:
```
for(i=0;i<3;i++) {
    fork();
}
execl("program",...):
```

Q9 - Sketch the outcome of this program:
```
for(i=0;i<8;i++) {
    execl("program",...):
}
fork();
```

Q10 - Sketch the outcome of this programm, and suggest why this might be a useful technique:

```
fork();
if(pid==0) {
    execl("program",...);
} else {
    _exit(0);
}
```

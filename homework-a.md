# Homework A - Metric Math

Review the [Metric Math Refresher](metric) and solve these problems.  Write all answers in the form
of small integers accompanied by appropriate metric units.  For example, write an answer
as 4MB, not 4194304 bytes.

I don't expect that these problems to be *hard*,
but you do need to be able to do them quickly and easily throughout the semesters.

Careful: **B** indicates a byte, while **b** indicates a bit.

Please write out your answers neatly and upload as a PDF or JPG on Canvas.

1 - Memorize the powers of two up to 2^10 and binary metric prefixes up to Exa.  Come up with a chant, a poem, a haiku, or something else to help you memorize them.  Practice with a classmate.

2 - How many bytes can be addressed by a CPU with a 24-bit address bus?

3 - How many 2KB blocks are there in a standard 700MB CD-ROM?

4 - A mechanical disk drive takes about 10ms to write a single 4KB data block in the worst case.  At this rate, how much data can it write in an hour?

5 - How many bytes can be addressed by a CPU with a 48-bit address bus?

6 - How many 16KB blocks are there in a 1TB hard disk?

7 - How long would it take to move 100GB of data over a USB-1.0 bus at 12Mb/s?

8 - ... over a USB-3.0 bus at 4.8Gb/s?

9 - ... over Gigabit Ethernet at 1Gbps?

10 - Suppose that you are designing a computer that requires 3GB of memory.  What is the minimum number of address bits needed?
